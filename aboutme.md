<p> Hi there! I'm Matheus, currently twenty years old. I was born in Northeast Brazil, in a town called Campina Grande, but passed by whole childhood in a small (<i>really, really small</i>) town just near it, Remigio. </p>
		
<p> When I was about twelve, my aunt started his undergraduate studies in Physics. She didn't finished it, and then I inherited all those books. I remember myself reading those books (of course, I could not understand the Calculus behind it), but nevertheless I fell for all those books - specially the fourth volume, "Optics and Quantum Physics" </p>

<p> After elementary school, I went for a technical diploma from the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology (IFPB), in Maintenance of Computer and Networks. During my four years there, I had the chance to learn the basics of electronics, computer networks, setup of Windows and Linux servers... There, I made my mind to study Electrical Engineering. It was in IFPB that I started doing research, first about security concerns of RFID applications and then in wireless sensor networks based on ZigBee. </p> 

<p> I started my undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering at the Federal University of Campina Grande at 2013. This major allows the student to have a general electrical engineering education, with obligatory courses in several subjects, and then the student starts choosing his specializations. Starting on 2015, I decided to follow one specialization in Electronics, <i>Digital Signal Processing</i>, and two specializations in Telecommunications <i>Computer Networks</i> and <i>Waveguides</i>. </p>

<p> My years in UFCG have been full of research. Under the advise of Professor <a href="http://helderpereira.dee.ufcg.edu.br">Helder Pereira</a>, I started researching on Elastic Optical Networks. During two years, I had the chance of develop new algorithms for the Routing, Spectrum and Modulation Assignment problem. This research culminated with the development of the <a href="http://radiometria.dee.ufcg.br/simeon">Simulator for Elastic Optical Networks</a> and in several publications.</p>

<p> Currently, under a bilateral exchange problem between Brazil and France, I'm a double degree student at Phelma, part of the Grenoble Institute of Technology (G-INP). There, I am in the first year of a <i>Master</i> in Integrated Electronic Systems. </p>
